Welcome to my Solidity Projects Library — a curated collection of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) that showcase my learning journey, experiments, and accomplishments in Ethereum development.

This repository is continuously evolving as I explore more concepts in Web3, DeFi, and blockchain security.

## 🧱 About

This repository serves as:

* 📚 A **learning archive** of my progress in Solidity and smart contract development.
* 🛠️ A **hands-on playground** for testing ideas, patterns, and protocols.
* 🧪 A **sandbox** for building and breaking things to gain deeper understanding.
* 🏆 A **showcase** of notable challenges solved, vulnerabilities explored, and mini-projects completed.

Each project is self-contained in its own folder with code, notes, and sometimes foundry/hardhat setup for reproducibility.

| 📝 **Beginner Projects**     | Simple contracts like message boards, counters, etc.                        |
| 🔐 **Security Experiments**  | Vulnerability replications, signature bypass, reentrancy, tx.origin, etc.   |
| 📦 **DeFi Mini Clones**      | Re-creations of protocols (Uniswap, Aave snippets, flash loans)             |
| 🏗️ **Patterns & Standards** | Minimal proxies, upgradables, access control, ERCs (20, 721, 1155, 4626...) |
| 🔍 **Audits & CTFs**         | Audit practice exercises and Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges              |

## 🧪 Stack & Tools

* **Solidity** (0.8.x)
* **Foundry** (primary testing framework)
* Hardhat (occasionally)
* Etherscan / Tenderly for verification and tracing
* Slither, MythX, or custom scripts for analysis

## 🚀 How to Use

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/solidity-projects-library.git
cd solidity-projects-library

# Navigate into a project and follow its README or test with Foundry:
cd projects/some-contract
forge test
```

## 📈 Milestones & Highlights

* ✅ Deployed my first smart contract to Sepolia
* 🔍 Recreated and exploited a signature bypass in a multisig wallet
* 🧠 Submitted high-validity smart contract vulnerabilities
* ⚙️ Built reusable contract templates for ERC20 and custom modules
